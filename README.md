# Robbie

Simple sample project to test out modelling, mecanim, and AR

Currently, the project involves a simple character model and a third person controller setup, as well as animations and sample scenes to test out different lighting contexts.

The project uses skyboxes from [Fantasy Skyboxes by Render Knight](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/fantasy-skybox-18216) and Robbie's antenna is designed with [Dynamic Bone by Will Hong](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743) in mind.

See [here](https://unoctium1.github.io/Robbie) to preview Robbie in different lighting

To do:
AR work - integrate with existing vuforia Robbie AR project
